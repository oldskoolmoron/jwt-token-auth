ðŸš€ JWT Token Authentication â€“ Simplified and Secure! ðŸ”’

This repository covers the essentials of JWT (JSON Web Token) Authentication without middleware, showcasing how to manage user authentication in a stateless, secure, and efficient way. With JWT, we create tokens that securely represent a userâ€™s identity, eliminating the need for traditional sessions or cookies. Inside, youâ€™ll find examples of generating tokens, verifying them on each request, and handling user sign-ins and sign-ups! This is perfect for those looking to add security to their Node.js projects or dive deeper into token-based authorization. Let's make authentication easy and seamless!
